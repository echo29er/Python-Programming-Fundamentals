# Python Programming Fundamentals - Exercise Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises from the book "Python Programming Fundamentals". This is a personal learning project meant to track my progress and share knowledge with others learning Python.

## Repository Structure

```

```

Each chapter has its own directory containing:
- Individual Python files for each exercise solution
- A README explaining the chapter's main concepts and exercise objectives
- Any additional resources or notes needed for that chapter

## How to Use This Repository

1. Each solution is documented with:
   - The original exercise objective
   - Explanation of the approach used
   - The solution code
   - Example output
   - Any additional notes or alternative solutions

2. To run any solution:
   ```bash
   python chapterXX/exercise_XX_XX.py
   ```
